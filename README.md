# MineSweeper-Game
Mine Seeker , but with a twist of finding ZOMBIES instead of MINES , is a game where the player tries to find a certain number of mines which are randomly placed in cells on the game board. The player taps on a cell to inspect it. If the cell contains a mine, then the mine is revealed. If there is no mine, then inspecting the cell triggers a scan which shows the count of hidden mines in the same row and column as the selected cell. This information allows the player to make smart choices about which cells to inspect. The goal is to find all the mines using the minimum number of scans.
